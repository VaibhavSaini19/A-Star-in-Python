# A-Star-in-Python

This algorithm works on a maze or a graph provided in the form of a dictionary map having keys as tuples(Cartesian coordinates of current position) and values as a vector of tuples(Cartesian coordinates of neighbours). Since the hueristic is considered as 1 unit, the algorithm provides the shortest path toh the destination.
